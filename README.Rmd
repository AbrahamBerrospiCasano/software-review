# rOpenSci Onboarding

<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

Thank you for considering submitting your package to the rOpenSci suite. All
the packages contributed by community members go through a process of [open peer review](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/09/01/nf-softwarereview/) to ensure a consistent level of quality for our users. This process also allows us to ensure that your package meets our guidelines and provides opportunity for discussion where exceptions are requested. Read more about the reasons behind our onboarding system in [this chapter of our guide for rOpenSci package developers](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/onboarding-why-what.html).

Our [guide for rOpenSci package developers](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/) also includes:

* [a guide for authors, read this if you want to submit a package](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/onboarding-guide-for-authors.html)

* [a guide for reviewers](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/onboarding-guide-for-reviewers.html)

* [a guide for editors](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/onboarding-guide-for-editors.html)

* [our policies](https://ropensci.github.io/dev_guide/policies.html)

Our [code of conduct](policies.md/#code-of-conduct) is mandatory for everyone
involved in our review process.

Our review process is always in development, and we encourage feedback and discussion
on how to improve the process on our [forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/) and in the [ropensci/onboarding-meta issue tracker](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding-meta/issues).

We are grateful to the following individuals who have offered up their time and expertise to review packages submitted to rOpenSci.

```{r reviewers, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
editors <- c("Noam Ross", "Scott Chamberlain", "Karthik Ram", "Maëlle Salmon")
reviewers <- air_get(base = "appZIB8hgtvjoV99D", table = "Reviewers", combined_result = FALSE)
reviewers2 <- air_get(base = "appZIB8hgtvjoV99D", table = "Reviewers", combined_result = FALSE, offset=get_offset(reviewers))
reviewers <- rbind(reviewers$fields[, c('name', 'github', 'Reviews')], reviewers2$fields[, c('name', 'github', 'Reviews')])
reviewers <- reviewers[map_lgl(reviewers$Reviews, ~!is.null(.)) & !(reviewers$name %in% c(editors, "???")), ]
reviewers <- reviewers[order(reviewers$name), ]
cat(paste0("[", reviewers$name, "](https://github.com/", reviewers$github, ")", collapse = " \U00B7 "))
