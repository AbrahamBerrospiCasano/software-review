===================

Thank you for considering submitting your package to the rOpenSci suite. In order to ensure a consistent level of software quality for our users, we ask that you go through an onboarding process so we can better understand what your software does, and how we can help improve it before adding it to our suite. This process also allows us to ensure that your package meets our guidelines and provides opportunity for discussion where exceptions are requested.

## How to submit your package to the rOpenSci suite

* Begin by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/new).
* Copy the template from `Step 2` in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) into the issue body, and fill it out.  
* Once you have completed the template, submit the issue. Someone from our team will take a look within 5 business days and respond with next steps.  Once your package is approved, we will provide further instructions on transferring your repository to the rOpenSci organizational account.
