CONTRIBUTING
============

## Steps

1. Open an issue

2. Copy the following template into the issue and answer as concisely as possible:

    ```
    * URL for the package (the development repository, not a stylized html page)
    * Concise package description
    * What data source(s) does it work with (if applicable)?
    * Who is the target audience?
    * Check the box next to each policy below, confirming that you agree. These are mandatory.
        * [ ] policy 1
        * [ ] policy 2
        * [ ] policy 3
        * [ ] policy 4
        * [ ] policy 5
    * Do you agree to follow the [rOpenSci packaging guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/packaging_guide? These aren't mandatory, but we strongly suggest you follow them. If you disagree with any, explain.
    * Copy and paste the `DESCRIPTION` file from your package below these answers in a code block. Also, answer the following:
        * Does the package have a CRAN accepted license?
        * Are there any packages that your package depends on that are not on CRAN?
        * Do you intend for this package to go on CRAN?
    ```

3. Once you have completed the template, submit the issue. Someone from our team will take a look within 1-2 business days and respond with next steps.  Once your package is approved, we will provide further instructions on transferring your repository to the rOpenSci organizational account.
